# Welcome 👋

## Quick introduction about myself:

I work at Microsoft as Senior Program Manager for Azure Maps. I was born and raised in Costa Rica. I moved to Washington in 2018. I joined Microsoft in 2015. Before joining Microsoft, I was a Microsoft Most Valuable Professional, now I'm part of the MVP Reconnect program. I graduated from Computer Systems Engineer and finishing a Master degree for Information Technology Management. My experience is with Software Development, I have been involved in many projects for LATAM and United States focused on multiple Microsoft technologies. I'm a fan of the Microsoft Certifications therefore I'm Azure Developer certified, DevOps Engineer and Microsoft Trainer.

```I am here to help you build the best apps on top of Microsoft Azure.```
